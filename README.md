# Senior Project: ARCTIC

## Project Description
Welcome to the README file for our automated penetration testing program developed for the Army's Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) cyber range. The MDTF has tasked us with creating an innovative solution that enhances their cybersecurity defense training capabilities in a controlled environment. The primary objective of our project is to develop an automated penetration testing program that provides soldiers with realistic cybersecurity defense training. This involves simulating user activities, creating controlled noise, and replicating real-world cyber scenarios within various Microsoft Windows systems on their network
## Project Overview
1. **Establish a "Pseudo-Users" System:**
   - Develop a system that autonomously generates user activities, including simulating actions like creating files, sending emails, and executing random events.
   - Integrate the pseudo-users system into different Microsoft Windows systems within the MDTF network.

2. **Automate Red Team Actions:**
   - Implement automation for red team actions based on established repositories of known attacks.
   - Simulate red team activities to challenge and enhance soldiers' defensive skills.

3. **Enhance Realism and Complexity:**
   - Create a training environment that closely mirrors real-world cyber scenarios.
   - Provide soldiers with challenging and diverse training experiences to improve their readiness for cyber threats.
## Key Features
- **Pseudo-Users Management:**
  - Create, manage, and maintain pseudo-users within the MDTF network.
  - Simulate a wide range of user activities to create a realistic training environment.

- **Red Team Automation:**
  - Automate red team actions based on established repositories of known attacks.
  - Challenge soldiers with simulated cyber threats to enhance their defensive capabilities.

- **Flexibility and Customization:**
  - Provide flexibility to simulate various cyber attack scenarios.
  - Allow customization of training exercises based on specific objectives and skill levels.
## Technologies Used
